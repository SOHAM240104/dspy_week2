Payroll is biweekly on Fridays.\n\n- Standard hours: 9:00–17:30. Core collab: 10:00–16:00. Home-office stipend: $500 for new hires.",
        "reasoning": "According to our Time Off policy, full-time employees accrue 1.5 days of PTO per month, which is equivalent to 18 days per year.",

Loss must be reported in 24h.\n\n- Classifications: full-time, part-time, temporary, intern, contractor. Payroll is biweekly on Fridays.",
        "reasoning": "Since the lunch expense is under $75, a receipt is not required. Additionally, since alcohol is not reimbursable, the fact that it was purchased at a restaurant does not change the need for a receipt.",

Retaliation is forbidden.\n\n- Equipment: Choose MacBook Pro or Dell XPS. MFA required. Loss must be reported in 24h.",
        "reasoning": "According to the context, under $75 no receipt is needed, but more importantly, it specifically states \"No alcohol reimbursement.\" This policy clearly indicates that alcohol-related expenses are not eligible for reimbursement.",
